# GenXAI (Non‑Studio) Competitive Matrix

This document compares **GenXAI (core framework, excluding Studio UI)** against
popular agentic frameworks and workflow engines: **CrewAI**, **AutoGen**, **BeeAI**,
and **n8n**.

> Scope note: Studio‑specific GUI features are intentionally excluded from this comparison.

---

## Executive Summary

GenXAI’s **core runtime** is feature‑complete for agent workflows, tool orchestration,
multi‑provider LLM support, and **workflow triggers/connectors**. It competes well with
**CrewAI** and **AutoGen** in orchestration depth and tooling, but still trails **n8n**
on breadth of plug‑and‑play integrations and GUI‑first automation UX. Compared to
**BeeAI**, GenXAI offers stronger multi‑provider support, graph orchestration, and
enterprise‑grade observability/security.

Key gaps to reach parity across the board:

- Broader **connector ecosystem** (SaaS + enterprise systems)
- Rich **plugin marketplace** and community template packs
- Expanded **integration test matrix** for memory/vector store backends

### Weighted Totals

Weights (sum = 100):

| Dimension | Weight |
|---|---:|
| Agent orchestration depth | 15 |
| Workflow/graph flexibility | 12 |
| Provider breadth | 10 |
| Tooling & schemas | 10 |

Weighted score formula: **(score / 5) × weight**

**Normalization Notes**
- Scores are normalized to a **0–100** scale by multiplying each dimension’s 1–5 rating
  by its weight fraction (weight/100) and summing across dimensions.
- Weights are fixed per scenario and sum to **100**.
- A score of **100** represents a theoretical best‑in‑class solution scoring **5** on
  every dimension for the chosen weights.

| Framework | Weighted Total (0–100) |

| GenXAI (Core) | 76.8 |
| CrewAI | 61.8 |
| AutoGen | 75.2 |

- n8n dominates **automation UX, connectors, and enterprise polish**.
- AutoGen leads in **multi‑agent research depth** but requires more production scaffolding.
- CrewAI is strong in **agent collaboration + ecosystem**, less in advanced orchestration.
- BeeAI is solid for lightweight agentic automation but has a smaller ecosystem.

- Heavier setup for production orchestration.
- GUI/connector ecosystem is limited (outside of extensions).

### BeeAI
**Strengths**
- Lightweight agent automation patterns.

**Weaknesses**
- Smaller ecosystem and fewer enterprise‑grade observability/security modules.

### n8n

## Readiness Verdict (Non‑Studio)

**Competitive with CrewAI/AutoGen on core orchestration and tooling.**
GenXAI now includes **core triggers/connectors** and a **worker queue engine**.
To compete with **n8n** and broader enterprise platforms, GenXAI needs broader
connector coverage, richer templates, and ecosystem growth.

## Recommended Next Milestones

1. **Connector Ecosystem Expansion** (top SaaS + enterprise systems)
2. **Expanded Vector Store Coverage** + integration tests
3. **Template Marketplace** (discoverable workflow packs)
4. **Deployment Hardening** (K8s/Helm, secrets policy, CI benchmarks)
